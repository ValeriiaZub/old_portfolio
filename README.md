Hi im val

## Setup Development

Start compiling css

```bash
sass --watch ./scss/main.scss ./css/main.css
```

## Updating websute

1. do your changes (please no files bigger then 10mb)
2. run `git add .`. This will add all your changes to a staging area
3. run `git commit -m "i am a message`. This will commit the changes to memory
4. run `git push`. This will update your website

Better to run this often so if there is an issue with a big file you know what .gif it is
