            </h5>
            <p>I’ve been mentoring interaction design students for two years, including running workshops. I had a brief
                understanding of why people need mentoring. There are unique challenges in mentoring.
                <ul class="side_info mt-5">
                    <li>
                        Mentoring is guiding, tutoring is telling the answers. It is important to understand what type
                        of help people are seeking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What usually makes people ask for help is that they are struggling with a problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People are afraid to ask and re-ask “stupid questions”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is an assumption that a mentor has more power over a mentee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People get frustrated if they do not know the answer.

                    80% of mentees do not feel comfortable, when asking for help. This is why they want mentors to be
