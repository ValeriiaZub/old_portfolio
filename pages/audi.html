                    <p class="project-par"> We looked at the existing platform Audi has, myAudi. <span>Now the app is
                            just for the car
                            owners</span> and does not allow for passengers to access all the premium features inside
                        the car from their
                        phones.Unfortunately, accessing premium features like seat massage is awkward, and most
                        customers
                        probably
                        won’t even realize the features exist without being prompted.

                        instantly have access to all of these features right in front of them on their phone. With an
                        intuitive
                        design, it is obvious what you can control, and what features are available. </p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">The way it works </h3>
            <p class="project-par">The myAudi application on the <span>driver’s phone will act as a mediator</span>
                between the
                rideshare and the car. This ensures <span>the driver has full control</span> over the features accessed
                over the
                duration of the trip. For example, it would be able to set tolerances to things like the music volume.
                The driver would also be able to set a password for additional privacy. Also, <span>seat selection is
                    important for the hierarchy</span> to solve the conflict between two or more paired devices. </p>
            <img class="content-image" src="../images/audi/pairingEx.svg" alt="Scheme of device paring to a car">


            <h3 class="sub-heading">Data is the new resource</h3>
            <p class="project-par">This data can be very useful for knowing what preferences a person likes when they
                ride, what features are used most often, and how to best market their features to prospective buyers.
                This data also <span>lets Audi expand their knowledge of their consumer base</span>, answering questions
                such as who
                uses an Audi as a passenger, and what is Audi’s main demographic of people who use Audi in a rideshare.

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Second horizon</h3>
                    <p class="project-par">There are many input methods that could be employed in the future state.
                        Building on
                        the system we developed instead of the rideshare scanning a QR code <span>more seamless input
                            methods could be
                            deployed</span> like voice or face recognition. These input methods could offer a more
                        seamless experience
                        having rideshare preferences sync as soon as they enter the car (this would require the
                        rideshare to
                        have MyAudi).</p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">Looking further into the future </h3>
            <p class="project-par">Having end-user anonymously access all the premium features during their rideshare
                experience <span>builds up trust to the Audi brand</span>. In the future people might get so familiar
                with the
                digital service, so <span>it may become the reason why they would use audi cars to get somewhere</span>.
