                We looked at the existing platform Audi has, myAudi. Now the app is just for the car owners and does not
                allow for passengers to access all the premium features inside the car from their phones.

                When you get into a car, you want the experience tailored to you. Imagine getting in an Uber and having
                a massage! Unfortunately, accessing premium features like seat massage is awkward, and most customers
                probably won’t even realize the features exist without being prompted.
